# Capstone Project

This project was developed as a final evaluation for the Machine Learning Nano Degree, provided by Udacity. All the data needed to test this locally is on this repository, however it requires the use of AWS Services such as SageMaker and S3.

The libraries needed are on the *requirements.txt*
